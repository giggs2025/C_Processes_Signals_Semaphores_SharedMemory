# C (Processes, Signals, Semaphores, and Shared Memory)

## üìö Introduction

My name is **Stefano Caramagno**, and I'm pleased to present this repository containing exercises on **processes**, **signals**, **semaphores**, and **shared memory** implemented in **C programming language**. <br>
These exercises were completed as part of the **Operating Systems** course during my **Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering** at the **University of Catania**.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Process Creation**: Creates and manages multiple processes using system calls.  
- **Process Synchronization**: Coordinates execution between parent and child processes to ensure correct operation.  
- **Signal Handling**: Sends and processes signals for process control and communication.  
- **Shared Memory Management**: Uses shared memory segments for real-time data exchange between processes.  
- **Semaphore Synchronization**: Implements semaphores to regulate access to shared resources and prevent race conditions.  
- **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**: Enables processes to share and modify through shared memory and synchronization mechanisms.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: C for implementing concurrent programming and synchronization mechanisms.
- **Build System**: GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) for compiling and running C programs.
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code for development and debugging.  
- **Version Control**: Git for tracking changes and managing project versions.  
- **Repository Hosting**: GitHub for storing, sharing, and maintaining the project repository.  

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed on your system before proceeding:

- **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)**: Required required to compile and run C programs. 
  - **Linux**: Pre-installed or installable via package manager (`sudo apt install gcc`).  
  - **macOS**: Pre-installed or installable via Homebrew (`brew install gcc`).  
  - **Windows**: Requires one of the following:  
    - **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) ‚Äì Recommended**  
    - **Linux Virtual Machine** (Full compatibility)  
- **IDE**: Required to read and understand code efficiently.    
- **Git**: Used to clone the repository.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   
   To download the repository and navigate to its directory:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/stefanocaramagno/C_Processes_Signals_Semaphores_SharedMemory.git
   cd C_Processes_Signals_Semaphores_SharedMemory
   ```

2. **Compile the Programs**

   To compile a specific program (e.g., exercise_01.c):

   ```sh
   gcc exercise_01.c -o exercise_01
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Run the Program**

   To execute the compiled program:

   ```sh
   ./exercise_01
   ```
